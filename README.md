# docker-jupyterlab

This repository contains a container to run Jupyter Lab locally in Docker. It also contains several code puzzles in the
`./work/` directory to help familiarize yourself with using Jupyter notebooks.

## Usage

Run `docker-compose up`. In the log output, a tokenized URL will be generated for you to access the Jupyter Lab
application in a browser. If your terminal allows, you can simply click the localhost link in the output, or copy and
paste it into your browser.
